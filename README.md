Personal project to be used as my personal website in the future.  Any suggestions are helpful and appreciated. 
Utilizes bootstrap jumbotron div's with set background images and jQuery animations to make the content of the page central and make it stand out and attract attention.
The jQuery animations should be as clean as possible with out distracting attention away from the content.  It should promote not hinder the content.
